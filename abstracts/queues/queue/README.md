Queue

Queue is a collection of data in which the entities in the collection are kept in order in which they were assigned. Operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the end of the queue (enqueue), and removal of entities from the front of the queue (dequeue). This makes the queue a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.
