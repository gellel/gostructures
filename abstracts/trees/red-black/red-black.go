// Package binary exports a RedBlack-Search-Tree.
// A RedBlack-Search-Tree is abstract data structure that
// manages the insertion of floating point values so that they
// can be accessed and arranged in guaranteed O(log(n)) time.
// Each RedBlack-Search-Tree holds a collection of RedBlack-Tree-Nodes
// that manages the insertion and ordering of new nodes relative
// to the accessed RedBlack-Tree-Node.
// In the context of the RedBlack-Search-Tree, this action takes place
// relative to the root node. Package also exports a
// function "New" that simplifies instantiating
// RedBlack-Search-Tree pointers.
