##### Post-order Binary Tree Traversal

Post-order traversal of a Binary-Search-Tree is used to delete nodes from the accessed Tree tree. Post-order traversal is also useful to get the postfix expression of an expression tree. Post-order falls under the classification of Depth-First-Traversal algorithm.
